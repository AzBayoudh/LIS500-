     <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 15px;">Joy Buolamwini - Canadian computer scientist and digital activist</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">
        Joy Buolamwini is a computer scientist, researcher, and activist who is known for challenging the bias in artificial intelligence systems. 
        She was born in Canada to Ghanaian parents and raised in the United States. 
        Using her technical expertise and powerful advocacy, she can push for more ethical and equitable technology.
        As a graduate of MIT, she discovered that facial recognition systems often failed to detect her face, which led her to uncover the widespread racial/gender bias in most AI. 
        Her research on this topic showed that these systems worked best on lighter-skinned males and performed poorly on darker-skinned female faces. 
        In response to her findings, she founded the Algorithmic Justice League (AJL) to try and raise awareness on this issue. 
        Her work has led many of the major tech companies to make changes to their technology, and she even testified in front of Congress. 
        Along with this, she even appeared in a documentary called “Coded Bias.” By exposing these hidden biases, Buolamwini pushes the tech industry toward a fairer and inclusive AI.
