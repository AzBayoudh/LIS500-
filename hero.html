     <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 15px;">Joy Buolamwini - Canadian computer scientist and digital activist</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">
        Joy Buolamwini is a computer scientist and activist who challenges the bias in artificial intelligence. 
        Born in Canada to Ghanaian parents and raised in the United States, she uses her skills to push for fairer technology. 
        While attending MIT as a student, she found that facial recognition systems would often have issues with detecting her face, which revealed racial and gender bias. 
        Her further research on the topic showed that these systems worked best on white men, and worst on black women. 
        In response to this, she founded the Algorithmic Justice League (AJL) in order to raise awareness. 
        Her work also put pressure on many major tech companies to either improve their systems or take them down completely. 
        Along with this, she testified before congress and even featured in a documentary I have personally watched called “Coded Bias”. 
        These are just a few examples of the many accomplishments she has achieved over the years.
