       <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 15px;">Jennifer Opal – DevOps Engineer, Blogger, and Neurodiversity Advocate</p>

       <p style="text-align: center;">
         Jennifer Opal is a UK-based DevOps Engineer currently working at Dropbox Sign.  
         She’s also a multi-award-winning technologist, keynote speaker, and writer who uses her platform to promote inclusion and neurodiversity awareness in the tech industry.  
         Jennifer began her tech journey after taking a free “Intro to Web Development” course with Code First: Girls.  
         From there, she taught herself coding, earned an opportunity in Northern Ireland as a software engineer, and later became a DevOps Engineer.
       </p>

       <p style="text-align: center;">
         Her openness about living with dyslexia, dyspraxia, and ADHD has helped others see that neurodivergent people belong in tech too.  
         She’s shared her story in places like <em>The Guardian</em> and Bloomberg, and was recognized by ComputerWeekly as one of the  
         “Most Influential Women in Tech UK 2022.”  
         Jennifer’s career shows how resilience, community, and storytelling can change who gets seen and supported in tech.

         Joy Buolamwini – Canadian computer scientist and digital activist
       </p>

       <p style="text-align: center;">
         Joy Buolamwini is a computer scientist and activist who challenges bias in artificial intelligence.  
         Born in Canada to Ghanaian parents and raised in the United States, she uses her skills to push for fairer technology.  
         While attending MIT, she found that facial recognition systems often failed to detect her face, revealing racial and gender bias.  
         Her research showed these systems worked best on white men and worst on Black women.  
         In response, she founded the Algorithmic Justice League (AJL) to raise awareness and pressure major tech companies to improve their systems or take them down completely.  
         She also testified before Congress and was featured in the documentary <em>Coded Bias</em>.  
         These are just a few examples of the many accomplishments she has achieved over the years.
