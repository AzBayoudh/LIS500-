     <h1>Teachable Machine: Voice Classifier</h1>
     <p>
       On this page, we’re showcasing a sound-based machine learning project we built together using Google’s
       Teachable Machine. Our goal was to teach a simple model to recognize <strong>YES</strong>, <strong>NO</strong>,
       and <strong>QUIET</strong> through voice input. It’s a small example of how AI systems “learn” from the data
       humans feed them — and how bias can easily sneak into that process.

         “YES,” “NO,” or staying quiet and watch how the emoji changes in real time.

       <h3>Intro & Model Training</h3>
       <p>
         For this project, our group decided to build a Teachable Machine that could recognize sound. We wanted something
         simple but interactive, so we trained a model that listens for three categories — <strong>YES</strong>,
         <strong>NO</strong>, and <strong>QUIET</strong>. The idea was to explore how training data shapes a model’s behavior
         and connect that experience to the ideas from Joy Buolamwini’s <em>Unmasking AI</em>.
       </p>

       <p>
         I handled most of the training process and the setup for connecting our model to the website. We started by recording
         voice samples,  each of us saying “YES” and “NO” multiple times and capturing a few seconds of silence for “QUIET.”
         Our first version didn’t perform great. The model kept mixing things up and reacting to background noise. That made
         us realize how much the results depend on the data you feed it. We retrained it with more balanced samples, focusing
         on clearer, consistent recordings.
       </p>

       <p>
         Even after that, the model recognized my voice better than my partners’. It struggled with different tones and accents,
         which really connected to what Joy Buolamwini writes about, how algorithmic bias starts from uneven data. If a system
         is only trained on a narrow range of input, it’ll work best for people who match that input and less accurately for
         everyone else. It’s a small project, but it shows how bias can appear even without bad intentions.
       </p>

       <p>
         Once the model worked, I used <code>ml5.js</code> and <code>p5.js</code> to integrate it into our site. It took a few
         tries, I kept running into missing script errors and wrong model URLs, but eventually it came together. Watching the
         emoji respond in real time to our voices was honestly cool. It made all the debugging worth it and gave us something
         visual to share on this page.
       </p>
